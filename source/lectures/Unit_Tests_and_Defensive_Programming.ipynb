In this lesson, we look at ways to ensure bugs don't exist in the first place by using *unit tests* and *defensive programming* techniques.

Currently, for `normalize` to do what we say it does requires that the values in `a` are greater than or equal to zero.  Is that what we intended?  If not, we have a bug to fix, and the *unit tests* to be covered below will help us do that.

    "Armed with `unittest`, may I propose a philosophy for solving programming problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Before implementing a function, a module, or an entire program, **write the tests**.  Then, at every step of your development process, you can establish immediately whether your implementation is doing what you think it should be doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is philosophy is the basis for [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) (and, as you may note, has been encouraged all along with the homework testing files). Although test-driven development (or TDD) is a bonafide software development strategy, the basic concept of writing the test, failing the test, and then writing the code to pass the test is the important takeaway.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge, of course, is knowing what the tests should be.  Only after careful consideration of the requirements (whether from a homework problem statement, your boss, or a customer) can you begin to define the tests.  Over time, these tests might change (understanding improves) or grow in number (scope creep is real).  The important thing is to define tests sufficient in number and breadth so that every line of code can be shown to do what it is supposed to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise**:  Implement unit tests for a linear search function that given a sorted sequence `a` returns the first location of `v` in the array.  If `v` is not found, the location returned should be the (last) location of the element nearest to but smaller than `v`.   The goal here is to test for normal cases and *edge* cases, those particular cases that may break otherwise reasonable logic (think empty sequences, unordered sequences, sequences of just one element, `v` smaller than the smallest value in `a`, etc.)  Then, implement that linear search function to pass the tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise**: So the same for *binary search*.  *Hint*: Do you actually need to write new tests?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Exercise**: Write unit tests for a module with functions that analyze strings.  Specifically, write the tests for three functions: (1) `is_palindrome(s)` (that checks whether `s` is a [palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome)), (2) `longest_palindrome(s)` that returns the largest palindrome in `s`, and (3) `longest_common_sequence(s1, s2)` that returns the longest common substring shared by `s1` and `s2`."
